This is a backup commit of the http_module for  a http get request of an ldp container and a sparql query.
Place the ./libraries/* in the sites/all/libraries folder, and the ./modules/* in the ./sites/all/modules folder in your Drupal 7 installation (that is everything in the treee below libraries and modules respectively in the repository).

Make sure the libraries module is also installed.
